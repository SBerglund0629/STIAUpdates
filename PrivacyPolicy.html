            <h1 class="mb-4">Privacy Policy</h1>

            <p>
              This privacy policy (“Policy”) describes how the personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) you may provide on the
              <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://sunrisetexas.com">sunrisetexas.com</a> website (“Website” or “Service”) and any of its related products and services
              (collectively, “Services”) is collected, protected and used. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal Information
              and how you can access and update this information. This Policy is a legally binding agreement between you (“User”, “you” or “your”) and this Website
              operator (“Operator”, “we”, “us” or “our”). By accessing and using the Website and Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree
              to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals
              that we do not employ or manage.
            </p>

            <h2 class="h4 mt-5">Automatic collection of information</h2>
            <p>
              Our top priority is customer data security and, as such, we exercise the no logs policy. We may process only minimal user data, only as much as it is
              absolutely necessary to maintain the Website and Services. Information collected automatically is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and
              establish statistical information regarding the usage and traffic of the Website and Services. This statistical information is not otherwise aggregated
              in such a way that would identify any particular user of the system.
            </p>

            <h2 class="h4 mt-5">Collection of personal information</h2>
            <p>
              You can access and use the Website and Services without telling us who you are or revealing any information by which someone could identify you as a
              specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to use some of the features on the Website, you may be asked to provide certain Personal
              Information (for example, your name and e-mail address). We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us when you fill any online
              forms on the Website. When required, this information may include the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Personal details such as name, country of residence, etc.</li>
              <li>Contact information such as email address, address, etc.</li>
              <li>Information about other individuals such as your family members, friends, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Some of the information we collect is directly from you via the Website and Services. However, we may also collect Personal Information about you from
              other sources such as public databases and our joint marketing partners. You can choose not to provide us with your Personal Information, but then you
              may not be able to take advantage of some of the features on the Website. Users who are uncertain about what information is mandatory are welcome to
              contact us.
            </p>

            <h2 class="h4 mt-5">Use and processing of collected information</h2>
            <p>
              In order to make the Website and Services available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we need to collect and use certain Personal Information. If
              you do not provide the information that we request, we may not be able to provide you with the requested products or services. Any of the information
              we collect from you may be used for the following purposes:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Create and manage user accounts</li>
              <li>Respond to inquiries and offer support</li>
              <li>Improve user experience</li>
              <li>Run and operate the Website and Services</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with the Website and Services, where you are located in the world and if one of the
              following applies: (i) you have given your consent for one or more specific purposes; this, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal
              Information is subject to European data protection law; (ii) provision of information is necessary for the performance of an agreement with you and/or
              for any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject; (iv) processing
              is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us; (v) processing is necessary for the
              purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such processing (by opting out), without having to rely on
              consent or any other of the following legal bases below. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing,
              and in particular whether the provision of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.
            </p>

            <h2 class="h4 mt-5">Disclosure of information</h2>
            <p>
              Depending on the requested Services or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any service you have requested, we may share your information
              with your consent with our trusted third parties that work with us, any other affiliates and subsidiaries we rely upon to assist in the operation of the
              Website and Services available to you. We do not share Personal Information with unaffiliated third parties. These service providers are not authorized to
              use or disclose your information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements. We may share your Personal
              Information for these purposes only with third parties whose privacy policies are consistent with ours or who agree to abide by our policies with respect
              to Personal Information. These third parties are given Personal Information they need only in order to perform their designated functions, and we do not
              authorize them to use or disclose Personal Information for their own marketing or other purposes.
            </p>

            <h2 class="h4 mt-5">Retention of information</h2>
            <p>
              We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements
              unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information
              after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. Once the retention period expires, Personal Information shall be
              deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after the
              expiration of the retention period.
            </p>

            <h2 class="h4 mt-5">The rights of users</h2>
            <p>
              You may exercise certain rights regarding your information processed by us. In particular, you have the right to do the following: (i) you have the right
              to withdraw consent where you have previously given your consent to the processing of your information; (ii) you have the right to object to the processing
              of your information if the processing is carried out on a legal basis other than consent; (iii) you have the right to learn if information is being processed
              by us, obtain disclosure regarding certain aspects of the processing and obtain a copy of the information undergoing processing; (iv) you have the right to
              verify the accuracy of your information and ask for it to be updated or corrected; (v) you have the right, under certain circumstances, to restrict the
              processing of your information, in which case, we will not process your information for any purpose other than storing it; (vi) you have the right, under
              certain circumstances, to obtain the erasure of your Personal Information from us; (vii) you have the right to receive your information in a structured,
              commonly used and machine readable format and, if technically feasible, to have it transmitted to another controller without any hindrance. This provision
              is applicable provided that your information is processed by automated means and that the processing is based on your consent, on a contract which you are
              part of or on pre-contractual obligations thereof.
            </p>

            <h2 class="h4 mt-5">Email marketing</h2>
            <p>
              We offer electronic newsletters to which you may voluntarily subscribe at any time. We are committed to keeping your e-mail address confidential and will

              Services cannot be guaranteed; and (iii) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party, despite best efforts.
            </p>

            <h2 class="h4 mt-5">Data breach</h2>
            <p>
              In the event we become aware that the security of the Website and Services has been compromised or users Personal Information has been disclosed to
              unrelated third parties as a result of external activity, including, but not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve the right to take reasonably
